=== System context
#Describe the "ecosystem" surrounding your system, as far as possible without solution technology details.
It is a joint "setting the scene" for stakeholders and your engineers depicting all the roles and partner systems
the new solution is planned to integrate and interact with.#

#See also https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/ and esp. https://docs.arc42.org/tips/3-2/ for more hints about composing
context diagram. As we see the first chapter of the documentation less formal and technology driven than probably arc42
does, we recommend a business diagram enhanced with few technical bites the customer expects to see if start reading,
Deeper technical context diagrams and those that refer to solution details go into the logical building block section.#
